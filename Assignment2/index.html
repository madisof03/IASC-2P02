    <h1>Raven</h1>
    <h2>Paige Wolf</h2>

    <p>“Raven” by Edgar Allan Poe is a story he wrote about his beloved wife, Virginia. Virginia in this story is referred to as “Lenore”. The story explains the never escaping feeling of grief with death. The story is written from a first person point of view with Poe as the speaker. The story begins with Poe getting disrupted with his nap with some tapping at his chamber door. When opening the door he sees nothing, referring to not having Lenore anymore. After the tapping on the door, there was tapping at the window. Upon opening a raven came in and sat on top of the chamber door. The top of the chamber door to Poe is connected with Pallas Athena, the goddess of wisdom. The raven is described as sitting on her bust symbolizing having a shadow over the wisdom of death. </p>

    <p>Poe the rest of the story is confused on who the raven is. Why was the raven there? Where did he come from and why? Does he mean something? Is this a sign? Poe spiraled, questioning the presence of the raven. All the raven said back was “Nevermore”. There is not an ending to the grief he is feeling towards his late wife and there is never a time that he will get rid of this feeling of sadness. He refers to the Raven as being from the Night’s Plutonian shore, the land between the land of the living and dead. Poe kept asking the Raven to leave, connecting to the want of the feeling of grief to leave, and as expected the Raven just replied with “Nevermore”.</p>

    <p>The first visualization shows the words tapping, raven, and nevermore. Each word is seen in different parts of the text. Tapping is seen towards the beginning of the poem while nevermore was seen closer to the end. The Raven is seen throughout the visual. The word tapping is only seen in the first quarter of the book where Poe was setting the theme of something always being there. The Raven is then seen to carry the theme with a raven being a symbol of death. The Raven also only says the word “nevermore” which is seen in the second half of the poem. The words Raven and nevermore are seen at the same constant rate in the second half of the poem as well.</p>

        <h2>Allusions Mentioned</h2>

    <p>The second visualization consists of allusions. Allusions are references to other literary works, historical events, or philosophical ideas. The allusions mentioned are Pallas, Seraphim, and Pluto. Pallas Athena’s bust is mentioned in the poem as the raven sits on it, shadowing the wisdom of grief. Seraphim is a red-winged angel who is among the top hierarchy. The Seraphim flew through the open window and was asked by Poe to have him forget all his memories with “Lenore”.  Pluto or Hades was mentioned as a name of a shore the raven came from. Poe told the raven that they seem like they are from the Night’s Plutonian shore which is a part of the river that connects the land of the living and the dead. Each allusion is seen about 2 times throughout the whole poem. </p>

    <p>In conclusion, the theme of the poem is seen in the first visualization of the words tapping, Raven, and nevermore. The three allusions that are also seen throughout the poem connect to the Raven. The Raven sat upon Pallas Athena’s bust, was referred to as being from the Night’s Plutonian shore, and had an opposite representation than the Seraphim that flew into the room. The words raven and nevermore are constantly together in the last quarter of the poem because each stanza ends with the Raven reminding Poe that the end to the feeling of grief is nevermore.</p>

    <p>I used this poem because of how much of a resemblance ravens have with Edgar Allan Poe. I knew it would be a poem that I would be interested in. I think I could have made the visuals better if I used more common words. The reason I did not want to go with that is because there is not much meaning behind very common words. If I chose a longer text I would have been able to see more of a representation of common words that have great meaning.
