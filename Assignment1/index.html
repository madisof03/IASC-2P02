        <h2>1. Flatness</h2>

        <p><span class="clickable" id="first-change"> The people in the cave were presented with two triangles on the left and right side.</span> They wondered what story these two triangles were going to tell. The triangles remained still in the middle of the wall. All they see is shadows. Their world is full of shadows. Every shadow is flat, there is no depth or dimension to them. There is only one perspective to them. They thought that what they see is more than shown is not a concept they can grasp. The people in the cave’s world are flat. To them what they see is the truth of what is happening. They have a fixed viewpoint on the shapes they are viewing. The two triangles look identical to them. The flat surface of a triangle with a wide base. </p>

        <p>  <span class="clickable" id="second-change">All of a sudden the shapes switched.</span> The people in the cave were now presented with a circle on the left and a square on the right. Not knowing where the triangles went they accepted the new sight. Still with the mindset that there is one perspective to what they are seeing. No matter what angle they look at the shapes they remain flat. This shows that what they are presented with is always flat. The people in the cave have come to the conclusion that their world is flat. There is no other perspective that they can see and understand.

        <h2>2. Seeing Double</h2>

        <p>The people inside the cave saw the circle and square begin to move. The two shapes would switch between the original triangles and the circle and square. The people outside of the cave noted two cones in front of the light.     <span class="clickable" id="third-change">When two cones started to move the people outside of the cave saw that they rotated around and around showing their unique shaped bases.</span> The two cones have different bottoms. The closest cone has a circle bottom while the farthest cone has a square bottom. The people outside the cave see the world at a different angle that gives more information on what is happening in the real world. They can see the original shape is a cone while the people in the cave believe they are seeing a constant change of shape. The people inside the cave believe that the circle is turning into a triangle and back to a circle over time. They think the same for the square where it is turning in a triangle and back. The people outside the cave see that there are two cones that are rotating in a circle. By being able to see double, it is noticeable on what is actually happening. The square, circle, and triangles on the wall are being projected from a cone that when standing up right shows a triangle and when rotated 90 degrees shows their base. The difference in bases for the two cones showed the circle and square through the shadows. Both views, 2D and 3D, show different perspectives of the same event. A simple example is changing between the left eye, right eye, using both eyes, and not using any eyes when looking at something presents different angles one can view at giving them multiple perspectives. Even giving different angles to an event can change what one is seeing and perceiving. The people inside the cave see the circle and square constantly switching to the triangle and back. While the people outside the cave see two cones with different base shapes rotating in front of the light. 
        </p>


        <p><span class="clickable" id="fourth-change">Now, the shapes were stuck in the middle.</span> The triangles were not shown, but the circle and square were back. The people inside the cave were confused by the sudden change, but the longer they looked the more the shapes changed. <span class="clickable" id="fifth-change"> The circle turned into a square and the square turned into a circle.</span> While the people outside the cave saw that the two cones’ bases changed. The cones stayed at a 90 degree angle with the base facing away from the light. They noticed that the amount of faces on both cones changed with the adjustment to the shape of the bases. The people outside of the cave were not aware of the shape of the cones’ bases, but took note of the number of faces that changed. The cone closest to them decreased in faces, while the farther cone gained faces. After the change the two cones were opposite from what they looked like in the beginning. By being able to see double the truth of what is actually happening. There are now not two different perspectives of what is happening, but a more in depth description of what is happening. Being able to see double showed that the base of each cone was changing. The closest cone’s base changed from a round circle to a rigid square. The farther cone’s base went from the rigid square to the round circle. Without both views there would be different perspectives on what is being shown. Combining the two views, 2D and 3D, it was known that the cone’s base was changing, not just the number of faces on the cones or the amount of sides to the shapes.
